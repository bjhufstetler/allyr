Description: This package provides R functions that allow for easy interaction with Ally Invest's API. 
             Users can easily check their account holdings, get recent news headlines on specific stocks, and review
             their recent order history. Note: some functions require an active trading account with Ally Invest, as well
             authentication keys given from the Ally Invest API developers. However, there are functions that do not require
             any authentication.
